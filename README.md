# ADS-Drop-System
ADS-Drop-System is a highly stealthy, layered post-exploitation framework. It leverages NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS) for payload concealment and achieves multi-stage persistence via native LOLBAS techniques. ADS-Drop-System provides redundant, self-healing beacon access without dropping a single primary executable file to disk.
